--> Nothing happens to the stash until the restart is actually attempted.
    When the restarting process starts, the preRestart() step of the stash calls
     unstashAll() to return all messages to the mailbox. Therefore messages are
      not lost, and not kept in the stash, but just unstashed and returned to the
       mailbox.

--> If your actor is restarted, the contents of the Stash is maintained.
